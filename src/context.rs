//  context.rs — Multi-turn conversation context
//  https://github.com/paulfxyz/mang-sh
//
//  OVERVIEW
//  ────────
//  Without context, every `yo ›` prompt is completely independent.  The AI
//  has no memory of what it suggested before, so follow-up requests like:
//
//    yo ›  list all log files older than 7 days
//    yo ›  now delete them                          ← "them" = ?
//
//  ...break down because the model has no idea what "them" refers to.
//
//  This module solves that by maintaining a rolling window of the last N
//  (config.context_size, default 5) confirmed prompt/command pairs and
//  serialising them as prior conversation turns in each new API request.
//
//  HOW IT WORKS
//  ────────────
//  Each confirmed execution is recorded as a `Turn`:
//    - prompt:   the user's original natural-language request
//    - commands: the commands that were confirmed and run
//
//  When the AI module builds the next request, it prepends these turns as
//  "assistant" messages in the chat history, giving the model enough context
//  to resolve pronouns ("them", "it", "the same folder") and follow-up
//  intentions ("do it recursively", "now for staging instead of production").
//
//  WINDOW MANAGEMENT
//  ─────────────────
//  We keep at most `max_turns` entries.  When the window is full, the oldest
//  turn is dropped (FIFO / sliding window).  This prevents the context from
//  growing unboundedly and consuming excessive tokens on long sessions.
//
//  The window is in-memory only — it is not persisted to disk.  Rationale:
//    1. Context is session-specific; stale context from a past session
//       would confuse rather than help the model.
//    2. The prompt history may contain sensitive paths or data.
//    3. Keeping it in RAM keeps the code simple and safe.
//
//  TOKEN BUDGET AWARENESS
//  ──────────────────────
//  Each turn in the context costs tokens.  At 5 turns × ~50 tokens/turn =
//  ~250 tokens overhead — well within the 4k–32k context windows of modern
//  models and negligible against our 512-token max_tokens cap on output.
//  If a future version needs to trim aggressively, it can truncate the oldest
//  turns first since they are least relevant to the current request.
